# This script is executed in the Update-Bot container.
# It checks if the Dockerfile for the build container has changed.
# If so, it uses the version of the main branch as the basis for creating a new image tag.
# The script also checks if the image tag for the build image exists in the main branch.
# We assume that only one branch and one PR will be created for the changes in the build container.
# Therefore, we can update this branch as many times as we want and reuse the next available tag after the one from the main branch.
