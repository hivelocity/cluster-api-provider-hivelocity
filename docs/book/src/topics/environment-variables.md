# Environment Variables

You need the environment variables `HIVELOCITY_API_KEY` and `KUBECONFIG`.

We use [direnv](https://direnv.net/). This handy tools sets environment variables, as soon
as you enter a directory. The tool `direnv` does this by reading the file `.envrc`.

It is up to you, how you set the environment variables. You can use a different tool, too.

We provided an example file `.envrc.example`, which you should adapt to your environment.
