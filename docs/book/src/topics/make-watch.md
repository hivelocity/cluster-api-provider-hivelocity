# make watch

`make watch` is an ad-hoc monitoring tool that checks whether the management cluster and the workload cluster 
are operational.

If there is an error, then `make watch` will show it (‚ùå). 

Please create a [Github Issue](https://github.com/hivelocity/cluster-api-provider-hivelocity/issues) if `make watch` does not detect an error.

When the cluster starts some errors are common.

For example it will take up to 22 minutes until the ssh port of the first control plane is reachable.
